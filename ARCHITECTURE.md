# Architecture

TS3 Mobile is a single-server Android client. It keeps the TeamSpeak session in a
foreground service, exposes immutable state to Compose, and isolates protocol
and audio implementations behind small interfaces.

## Modules and boundaries

```text
Compose UI / MainActivity
        │  intents and immutable StateFlow
        ▼
TeamSpeakService (Android application layer)
        ├── Ts3SessionClient (protocol port)
        ├── OpusAudioPlayer / OpusMicrophoneCapture (audio ports)
        └── IdentityVault (local encrypted storage)
                │
                ├── ts3-protocol (JVM models, session adapter, channel ordering)
                └── audio-opus (JNI libopus/RNNoise and Android audio I/O)
```

`ts3-protocol` is JVM-only and does not import Android classes. `audio-opus`
contains the concrete audio infrastructure and depends on protocol data types,
not on Compose. The Android `app` module owns lifecycle, permissions,
notifications, reconnection orchestration and user-visible error mapping.

## State and concurrency

`TeamSpeakServiceState` is the single UI state model. The service publishes it
through a read-only `StateFlow`; UI code never mutates service state directly.
Session replacement is guarded by a `Mutex` and `SessionGeneration`, a
thread-safe monotonically increasing lifecycle token. The protocol adapter uses
the equivalent `SessionGenerationGate` to serialize generation checks with
snapshot mutations, so callbacks from an old session cannot write into a new
snapshot. A per-connection `ConnectionAttemptGate` atomically orders asynchronous
failures with the `CONNECTED` status; a failure cannot be overwritten by a late
success notification. `MicrophoneController`
owns microphone permissions, push-to-talk intent, capture lifecycle and the
separate transmit mutex; it updates the shared immutable service state through
the application-layer state flow.

`SessionSnapshotStore` is the protocol adapter's synchronized mutable boundary.
It converts ts3j events into immutable `SessionSnapshot` values before crossing
the module boundary.

`Ts3jSessionClient` keeps its public no-argument construction compatible while
obtaining sockets through an internal `Ts3jClientSocket` port. The production
adapter delegates to ts3j; JVM facade tests use a fake port to exercise session
replacement, stale event delivery and connection-status ordering without UDP.

`OpusAudioPlayer` uses Android's voice-communication audio attributes and asks
for audio focus only while a remote talkspurt is being played. `AudioFocusPolicy`
classifies framework callbacks into gain, interruption and ignore signals;
interruptions clear queued voice and mute output without changing the user's
microphone mode. `AudioDeviceRouter` owns communication-device selection, while
playback and capture receive legacy preferred-device hints only on Android
versions before the communication-device API.

`ChannelRestorePolicy` keeps the last channel target, including its password,
outside the session callback implementation. A reconnect snapshot cannot replace
that target while restoration is pending, and an already-restored channel is not
joined again.

## Diagnostics

`DiagnosticsRecorder` is a thread-safe, in-memory counter owned by the service.
It records connection attempts, reconnects, failures and audio frame counts
without storing host names, passwords, nicknames or participant data.
`DiagnosticsSnapshot.toRedactedJson()` is suitable for bug reports after the
user has reviewed it.

## Known decomposition work

`MainScreen.kt` now owns only the top-level scaffold and status surfaces.
Connection, connected-session, channel, participant, microphone and diagnostics
surfaces live in focused files under the same `ui` package, each below the
preferred 300-line review boundary.

`TeamSpeakService.kt` remains larger than that boundary because connection,
reconnection, playback routing and foreground-service state currently share
lifecycle invariants. Microphone capture has moved to `MicrophoneController`.

The remaining first-party files near or above the preferred 300-line review
boundary have been assessed as follows. Vendored RNNoise sources are excluded
from this project-specific decomposition policy.

| File | Current responsibility assessment | Planned extraction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TeamSpeakService.kt` | Too broad: connection, reconnect, playback routing, notifications and binder commands | Extract `ConnectionCoordinator`, then playback/routing and foreground-notification controllers |
| `OpusAudioPlayer.kt` | Playback lifecycle is cohesive, but jitter/talker buffering and Android output are independently testable | Extract the talker jitter pipeline and `AudioTrack` creation without changing frame timing |
| `OpusMicrophoneCapture.kt` | Capture lifecycle is cohesive; audio-effect setup and capture measurements are secondary concerns | Extract the effect chain and measurement helpers while keeping the capture thread single-owner |
| `Ts3jSessionClient.kt` | Protocol facade also maps ts3j callbacks and failures | Extract event and failure adapters while retaining the JVM-only public facade |
| `AudioDeviceRouter.kt` | Slightly above the boundary but still one cohesive routing responsibility | Extract device classification only if routing families or platform branches grow |

The extraction order is service orchestration, playback buffering, capture
effects, then protocol mapping. Each step must preserve the public service
binder and protocol facade, session-generation rejection of stale callbacks,
the bounded audio queue, and existing test fixtures. This avoids combining a
large structural change with the outstanding M10 physical-device acceptance
matrix.

## Compatibility and release scope

The public app API is intentionally small and internal to the Android app. The
protocol facade pins a ts3j revision. The current release target is a pre-release
single-server client; text chat, file transfer, server bookmarks and
multi-server tabs are outside this architecture until a new decision record is
approved.
